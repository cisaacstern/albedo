You can view the movies you've saved here.
There will be a fileselector.
    - names of the folders will reflect model run, e.g. DATE20200613_RSB0300532
Inside the folder will be:
    - a json config with the model settings
    - the static timeseries plot
    - the video of the time series plot with a vertical line marker,
      and updating rasters along with updating timepoint
    - the dataframe as csv: w/ columns for your selected curves
    - sub directory of timeinvariant arrays, in {numpy, matlab, or ascii}
        - 2D elevation, e.g. DATE20200613_RSB0300532_E.npy
        - 2D slope, e.g. DATE20200613_RSB0300532_S.npy
        - 2D aspect, e.g. DATE20200613_RSB0300532_A.npy
    - sub directory of arrays, in {numpy, matlab, or ascii}
        - subdirectory of masked elevation arrays
            - one 2D array for each timepoint, e.g. DATE20200613_TIME0745_RSB0300532_ME.npy
        - subdirectory of masked slope arrays
            - one 2D array for each timepoint, e.g. DATE20200613_TIME0745_RSB0300532_MS.npy
        - subdirectory of masked aspect arrays
            - one 2D array for each timepoint, e.g. DATE20200613_TIME0745_RSB0300532_MA.npy
        - subdirectory of un-masked aspect arrays
            - one 2D array for each timepoint, e.g. DATE20200613_TIME0745_RSB0300532_UM.npy
        - subdirectory of masked M arrays
            - one 2D array for each timepoint, e.g. DATE20200613_TIME0745_RSB0300532_MM.npy
        - subdirectory of masks
            - one 2D array for each timepoint, e.g. DATE20200613_TIME0745_RSB0300532_MSK.npy
